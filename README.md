README: Speech-to-Text AI Assistant
This project is a Speech-to-Text AI Assistant that combines Google Generative AI, Speech Recognition, and Text-to-Speech technologies. The assistant captures spoken input, generates a response using a generative AI model, and reads the response aloud.

Features:
1.Captures voice input using a microphone and converts it to text.
2.Leverages Google Generative AI for intelligent responses.
3.Reads the AI-generated response aloud using pyttsx3.
4.Processes speech through Google Web Speech API for high accuracy.
5.Simple and interactive interface for natural language queries.

Setup:

Install the required libraries: google-generativeai, speechRecognition, and pyttsx3.
Configure your Google API key in the script for AI model access.

Note:

Ensure PyAudio is installed and your microphone is working correctly.
